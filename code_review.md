# Code review guidelines for R users

> “The idea of code review is pretty simple: have other people review the code after someone wrote it.” - [Karl E. Wiegers](https://egoless.tech/code-review-essentials/)

## Checklist for reviewers
First make sure you understand the real-world context behind the code and the problem it is trying to solve. Ask the author if you’re not sure. Summarise your review before going into detail and always try to include some praise. There is no such thing as perfect code or a complete review. So maximise the impact of your review by limiting yourself to no more than:
* 1 hour of your time
* 300 words
* 10 most important points

Use this list as a prompt for what to review. But don’t feel limited by it. You can bring other things to the review that you think will help the author.

### :heavy_check_mark: Clearly organised file structure
Is it clear which file is the overarching script (i.e. that runs through all necessary steps and scripts)? Can you easily see how all the files relate to each other? Could scripts be split into categories? For example: utility functions, data import, and graphical output.

### :heavy_check_mark: Good coding practices
*Rhi is working on a separate document for this*

Don’t go into detail on specific style issues. If style comes up, recommend tidyverse and lintr.

### :heavy_check_mark: Runs on your machine
Does it produce the expected and correct output?

### :heavy_check_mark: Understandable code
Would a new start have difficulty understanding?

### :heavy_check_mark: Simple code
Watch out for things like complicated homemade functions when a Tidyverse function would suffice. Or code that needed to be explained to you.

### :heavy_check_mark: Well-chosen packages
Do you see any niche, outdated, or arbitrarily chosen packages?

### :heavy_check_mark: Appropriate testing
Is input data being automatically checked for validity and sanity? Are there any cases where it might break?

### :heavy_check_mark: Something praiseworthy
Did the author do something well? Did you learn something from their code?

## Expected behaviour during code reviews

### Both parties
* Assume competence and ask questions to gain understanding
* Provide rationale or context such as a best practices document or a style guide
* Don’t criticize the person. Instead, discuss the code

### Reviewer
* Provide specific and actionable feedback
* Clearly mark nitpicks and optional comments with the prefix ‘Optional’

### Author
* Clarify code or reply to the reviewer’s comment in response to feedback

## The benefits of code reviews

### Benefits for analysts
* Better structured and documented work that is easier to understand and modify
* Better techniques learned from other developers
* Less time spent reworking code
* More robust designs that tolerate change
* Ability to use results from previous reviews to make decisions

### Benefits for managers
* Improved teamwork, collaboration, and coding skills
* Reduced chance of errors in outputs
* Increased chance of completing the project on time
* Reduced lifetime maintenance costs, freeing resources for other work
* Reduced impact from staff turnover through cross-training of team members
* Better and earlier insight into project risks and quality issues
